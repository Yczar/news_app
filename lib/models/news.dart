That’s \$50 off the official price, and \$20 lower than the usual discounts. You can also score the standard AirPods for \$130 if you’re content to charge with a cable.As has been true ever since launch, the AirPods’ chief allure is convenience. They’re easy to set up on an iOS device, switch seamlessly between multiple Apple devices and have conveniences like always-available “Hey Siri” and automatic pausing when you remove a bud. The wireless case makes it that much easier to top up at the end of a long day.\n\nThe same caveats still apply. While you technically can use AirPods with Android and Windows devices, they clearly work best within Apple’s ecosystem. The buds’ five-hour claimed battery life is strictly acceptable (you’ll be thankful for that battery case). And if the EarPods that came with your iPhone don’t fit you well, the AirPods won’t either. You’ll want to look at alternatives like the AirPods Pro if you want something better-suited to workouts. Still, there are some reasons why AirPods are popular — they take many of the hassles out of Bluetooth earbuds.",

        "There are a number of different technologies both proposed and in development to help smooth the reopening of parts of the economy even as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continues. One such tech solution launching today comes from Brian McClendon,  co-founder of Keyhole,  the company that Google  purchased in 2004 that would form the basis of Google Earth and Google Maps. McClendon’s new CVKey Project is a registered nonprofit that is launching with an app for symptom self-assessment that generates a temporary QR code, which will work with participating community facilities as a kind of health “pass” on an opt-in basis.\n\nUltimately, CVKey Project hopes to launch an entire suite of apps dedicated to making it easier to reopen public spaces safely.  Apple and Google recently launched an exposure notification API that would allow CVKey to include those notifications in its apps. CVKey also plans to provide information about facilities open under current government guidelines and their policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as much as possible.\n\nThe core element of CVKey Project’s approach, however, is the use of a QR code generated by its app that essentially acts as a verification that you’re “safe” to enter one of these shared spaces. The system is designed with user privacy in mind, according to McClendon. Any identity or health data exists only on a user’s individual device — no date is ever uploaded to a cloud server or shared without a user’s consent. Information is also provided about what that sharing entails. Users voluntarily offer their health info, and the app never asks for location information. Most of what it does can be done without an internet connection at all, McClendon explains.\n\nWhen you generate and scan a QR code at a participating location, a simple binary display (based on the location’s policies) indicates whether you’re cleared to pass. The location won’t see any specifics about your health information. The code simply transmits the particulars of shown symptoms (which ones and how recently, for instance), and then that is matched against the  public space’s policy. The app then provides a “go”/”no-go” response.\n\nMcClendon created CVKey Project with former Google Earth, Google Maps and Uber  co-workers Manik Gupt and Waleed Kadous, as well as Dr. Marci Nielsen, a public health specialist with a long history of public and private institution leadership.\n\nThe apps created by CVKey Project will be available soon, and the nonprofit is looking for potential partners to participate in its program. Like just about everything else designed to address the COVID-19 crisis, it’s not a simple fix, but it could form part of a larger strategy that provides a path forward for dealing with the pandemic.",

        "Now’s a prime opportunity to get some AirPods if you’d like them for your walks or just to improve your video calls. Amazon is selling AirPods with a wireless charging case for \$150. That’s \$50 off the official price, and \$20 lower than the usual discounts. You can also score the standard AirPods for \$130 if you’re content to charge with a cable.As has been true ever since launch, the AirPods’ chief allure is convenience. They’re easy to set up on an iOS device, switch seamlessly between multiple Apple devices and have conveniences like always-available “Hey Siri” and automatic pausing when you remove a bud. The wireless case makes it that much easier to top up at the end of a long day.\n\nThe same caveats still apply. While you technically can use AirPods with Android and Windows devices, they clearly work best within Apple’s ecosystem. The buds’ five-hour claimed battery life is strictly acceptable (you’ll be thankful for that battery case). And if the EarPods that came with your iPhone don’t fit you well, the AirPods won’t either. You’ll want to look at alternatives like the AirPods Pro if you want something better-suited to workouts. Still, there are some reasons why AirPods are popular — they take many of the hassles out of Bluetooth earbuds.",

And so, like any celebrity who wants to start her day off with a ray of positivity, she hopped on Twitter to engage.\n\nOver the course of the next several hours, as legions of crypto try-hards leapt at the opportunity to explain consensus algorithms, Rowling`s nascent views on Bitcoin turned from mildly inquisitive to a friendly mocking.\n\nPerhaps it was the fourth Old Fashioned speaking?\n\n"People are now explaining Bitcoin to me, and honestly, it`s blah blah blah collectibles (My Little Pony?) blah blah blah computers (got one of those) blah blah blah crypto (sounds creepy) blah blah blah understand the risk (I don`t, though.)," she tweeted. "I know you mean to help, but full disclosure: I’m only allowing myself alcohol at weekends during this lockdown and I`m on my fourth very strong Old Fashioned and honestly, you might as well send me a scroll written in Sanskrit."',

        "There are a number of different technologies both proposed and in development to help smooth the reopening of parts of the economy even as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic continues. One such tech solution launching today comes from Brian McClendon,  co-founder of Keyhole,  the company that Google  purchased in 2004 that would form the basis of Google Earth and Google Maps. McClendon’s new CVKey Project is a registered nonprofit that is launching with an app for symptom self-assessment that generates a temporary QR code, which will work with participating community facilities as a kind of health “pass” on an opt-in basis.\n\nUltimately, CVKey Project hopes to launch an entire suite of apps dedicated to making it easier to reopen public spaces safely.  Apple and Google recently launched an exposure notification API that would allow CVKey to include those notifications in its apps. CVKey also plans to provide information about facilities open under current government guidelines and their policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as much as possible.\n\nThe core element of CVKey Project’s approach, however, is the use of a QR code generated by its app that essentially acts as a verification that you’re “safe” to enter one of these shared spaces. The system is designed with user privacy in mind, according to McClendon. Any identity or health data exists only on a user’s individual device — no date is ever uploaded to a cloud server or shared without a user’s consent. Information is also provided about what that sharing entails. Users voluntarily offer their health info, and the app never asks for location information. Most of what it does can be done without an internet connection at all, McClendon explains.\n\nWhen you generate and scan a QR code at a participating location, a simple binary display (based on the location’s policies) indicates whether you’re cleared to pass. The location won’t see any specifics about your health information. The code simply transmits the particulars of shown symptoms (which ones and how recently, for instance), and then that is matched against the  public space’s policy. The app then provides a “go”/”no-go” response.\n\nMcClendon created CVKey Project with former Google Earth, Google Maps and Uber  co-workers Manik Gupt and Waleed Kadous, as well as Dr. Marci Nielsen, a public health specialist with a long history of public and private institution leadership.\n\nThe apps created by CVKey Project will be available soon, and the nonprofit is looking for potential partners to participate in its program. Like just about everything else designed to address the COVID-19 crisis, it’s not a simple fix, but it could form part of a larger strategy that provides a path forward for dealing with the pandemic.",
